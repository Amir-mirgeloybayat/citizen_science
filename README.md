# citizen_science
The Citizen Science app is a platform for creating, distributing, and taking user-made surveys. Survey makers can make survey within the app, distribute a unique ID to potential respondents, and view their responses to the survey at any time. Responses can be viewed individually, or collated into a summary format that gives the total number of responses for each option.
