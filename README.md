The Citizen Science app is a platform for creating, distributing, and taking user-made surveys. Survey makers can make survey within the app, distribute a unique ID to potential respondents, and view their responses to the survey at any time. Responses can be viewed individually, or collated into a summary format that gives the total number of responses for each option.

Surveys come in two forms: Spotter, and Multiple Choice. Spotter surveys present users with a list of trackable items, and allows them to input a number for each item. This could be used to count sightings of different types of wildlife, or cars passing through an intersection. Multiple Choice surveys follow the typical format of presenting a series of questions, each with multiple possible answers to choose from. Respondents must choose an answer for every question before submitting their survey.

Users can create and login to user accounts within the app, authenticated by password. A user's authentication state will be remembered from session-to-session, until they specifically choose to log out. Authentication (alongside the survey data itself) is handled through Google's Firebase platform.
